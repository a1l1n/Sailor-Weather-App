# :last_quarter_moon_with_face: Sailor Weather App :star:
This project it's a SPA that consumes https://openweathermap.org/api API to provide information of the weather in the city that you wanna know in real time.

It's all **React** and **CSS**, with **SweetAlerts** when there's no coincidence between the searching and de API info. The responsive is still in progress :relaxed: :wrench:
